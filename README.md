# Tony Totts Mystery Game [HONORS COLLEGE PROJECT FOR CS 302]

## This is a mystery text adventure program written for the honors college.

This project utilizes the Dictionary ADT, which I had to implement myself. I had to learn about this ADT outside of class.
Along with the Dictionary, I also used a Linked List, which I made earlier in the school year.

To play the game, pleae only input when prompted to! Hitting enter in advance may break the input!
